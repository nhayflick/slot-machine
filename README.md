#Espresso Bar Slot Machine
An AngularJS Slot Machine App using local storage to persist prizes between browser sessions.

A build of the most recent version is compiled into the dist folder.

##How to Run:
For quick local access to the Slot Machine app, `cd` into the dist folder and run:

```python -m SimpleHTTPServer```

Then point your web browser to localhost:8000.

If you have the grunt build system installed, you can also run `grunt serve:dist` inside the repo to launch Grunt's built-in web server.
